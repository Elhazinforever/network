  This guide from the National Democratic Institute (NDI) serves to equip civil
  society groups, election administrators and technologists with the concepts
  and tools to effectively advocate for, implement and use election data that is
  truly “open," and for stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the
  election process and what kinds of data are produced during each phase of an
  electoral cycle. NDI launched the Open Election Data Initiative (OEDI) to
  equip civil society, election administrators and technologists with the
  concepts and tools to effectively advocate for, implement and use election
  data that is truly “open.” The initiative identifies nine open election data
  principles (truly “open” election data is timely, granular, available for free
  on the internet, complete and in bulk, analyzable, non-proprietary,
  non-discriminatory, license-free and permanently available) and outlines the
  types of data and what open data may look like throughout 16 different stages
  of an election process, from the pre-election period through election day and
  into the post-election period. The interactive OEDI website includes a guide
  on Unleashing the Potential of Election Data, an inventory of election data
  openness in 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, an Assessment
  Guide for citizen monitors to integrate an open election data strategy into
  their broader observation efforts, and an Election Data Academy with practical
  learning modules.
