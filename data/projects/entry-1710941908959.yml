description: "Access to critical data remains a significant hurdle for professionals across various sectors in South Africa, particularly for journalists requiring data under government custody. Despite strides towards International Open Data standards by the South African government, a knowledge gap exists among journalists regarding available data access points, leading them to depend on the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) for information retrieval.\r\n\r\nThe 2024 national elections in South Africa underscore the urgent need for journalists to access a comprehensive set of data, including financial performance, capital expenditure, census data, municipal data and service delivery implementation. The project aims to bridge this gap, ensuring journalists are well-equipped with necessary data to enhance electoral coverage and public awareness.\r\n\r\nOpenUp developed the SANEF election dashboard in 2021. The vision for the dashboard is to be leveraged effectively for the post-election context, and in anticipation of future elections, using user-centred design practices to potentially evolve into a Local Government Data Dashboard for data driven reporting."
