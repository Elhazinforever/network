description: >-
  NDI launched the Open Election Data Initiative (OEDI) in 2015 to equip civil
  society, election administrators and technologists with the concepts and tools
  to effectively advocate for, implement and use election data that is truly
  “open.” The initiative identifies nine open election data principles (truly
  “open” election data is timely, granular, available for free on the internet,
  complete and in bulk, analyzable, non-proprietary, non-discriminatory,
  license-free and permanently available) and outlines the types of data and
  what open data may look like throughout 16 different stages of an election
  process, from the pre-election period through election day and into the
  post-election period. The interactive OEDI website includes a guide on
  Unleashing the Potential of Election Data, an inventory of election data
  openness in 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, an Assessment
  Guide to support citizen monitors to integrate an open election data strategy
  into their broader observation effort, and an Election Data Academy with
  practical learning modules.
