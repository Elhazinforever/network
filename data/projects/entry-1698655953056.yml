description: "Regarding Thailand's May 2023 general election, our team dedicated its efforts to crafting a series of initiatives as part of the 'WeVis Election '66' campaign (https://election66.wevis.info). Our primary objective revolved around furnishing essential election-centric data and information. This initiative aimed to empower voters with the insights they need to make informed choices on election day while nurturing productive societal discourse.\r\n\r\nWe embarked on the creation of two novel websites aimed at delivering comprehensive information to voters for the 2023 election: 'Your Candidates' (https://election66.wevis.info/yourcandidates) and 'Policy Shop' (https://election66.wevis.info/policyshop). These platforms offer intuitive avenues for exploring a multitude of candidates and the policies proposed by 70 different political parties, all while facilitating an understanding of the election rules. The development of 'Your Candidates' serves to assist voters in locating their respective electorates, subsequently leading them to curated lists of candidates for both their district and party list. These profiles are enriched with essential information and linked to our 'They Work for Us', 'Promise Tracker', and 'Law Watch' databases. 'Policy Shop' adopts an e-commerce-inspired approach, presenting political campaigns categorized by topics and parties. This platform empowers users with comparison tools and keyword search functionality. \r\n\r\nWe also embarked on the development of three more projects under the election campaign umbrella, each designed to provide voters and the press with valuable resources to foster meaningful discussions based on pertinent data. 'Election SIM' (https://election66.wevis.info/electionsim) was crafted through the implementation of a calculation model that forecasts potential election outcomes. This intricate simulation relied on datasets including the 2019 election results, adjusted electoral constituency changes, politicians' crossovers, and voter opinions. While constructing this model posed challenges, rendering it user-friendly for voters was an even more intricate task. \r\n\r\nSee more in https://github.com/wevisdemo/thailand-election-2023"
