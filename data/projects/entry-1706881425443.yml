name: eMonitor+
description: "eMonitor+ is a social media analysis and monitoring system that includes a set of digital tools, with advanced artificial intelligence capabilities, which is used to expand national, regional, and global stakeholder capacities to analyze and address a range of challenges, including but not limited to toxic communication, hate speech, disinformation, and gender-based violence. This is particularly useful in countries and regions where such critical issues are understudied. eMonitor+ collects and analyses thousands of pieces of online content daily, from platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, as well as website content and offline media.   \r\n\r\nThe system integrates external tools and solutions into UNDP-built software. Nonetheless, human monitors lead its operation, utilizing the suite's automated functions to streamline otherwise time-consuming tasks. This fusion of human oversight and AI-driven analytics results in a more cost-effective, time-efficient, and comprehensive monitoring process. Every eMonitor+ deployment is accompanied by comprehensive technical support, enabling national stakeholders to develop and execute information integrity strategies that are evidence-based and tailored to address the unique challenges of their contexts. Outcomes can include advancing long-term digital resilience, particularly in the form of innovative policies, encouraging whole-of-society responses, and enhancing media literacy and public awareness."
