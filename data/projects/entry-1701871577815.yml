description: >-
  The National Democratic Institute (NDI) launched the Open Election Data
  Initiative (OEDI) to equip civil society, election administrators and
  technologists with the concepts and tools to effectively advocate for,
  implement and use election data that is truly “open.” The initiative
  identifies nine open election data principles (truly “open” election data is
  timely, granular, available for free on the internet, complete and in bulk,
  analyzable, non-proprietary, non-discriminatory, license-free and permanently
  available) and outlines the types of data and what open data may look like
  throughout 16 different stages of an election process, from the pre-election
  period through election day and into the post-election period. The interactive
  OEDI website, currently available in multiple languages, includes a guide on
  Unleashing the Potential of Election Data, an inventory of election data
  openness in 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, an Election Data
  Academy with practical learning modules, and an Assessment Guide which will
  support citizen monitors to integrate an open election data strategy into
  their broader observation effort.
