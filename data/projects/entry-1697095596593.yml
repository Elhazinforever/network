It is a basic healthcare need for millions of women, girls and others who can become pregnant within Dubai / UAE, Qatar / Doha, Kuwait  Medication abortion (also known as medical abortion or the abortion pill) is an alternative to surgical abortion. This type of abortion can be performed in the early weeks of pregnancy (up to 9 weeks).\r\nDR OLESKO WHATSAPP ((+971589738375)) ABORTION PILLS AVAILABLE IN KUWAIT CITY, BUY CYTOTEC AND MISOPROSTOL, ABORTION PILLS FOR SALE IN KUWAIT CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nMedication abortion uses a combination of 2 medications – mifepristone and misoprostol – to end an unplanned pregnancy.\r\n\r\nMedication abortion is a low-risk, non-invasive way to terminate (end) a pregnancy. It is around 99% effective.\r\n\r\nAround 2 to 5% of people who have a medication abortion will need some follow up treatment to complete the abortion.\r\n\r\nAn increasing number of GPs in Victoria provide medication abortions. Some services offer telehealth as an option via a phone call and your tests are organised locally.\r\n\r\nVisit our page Abortion in Victoria for more information about where to find an abortion provider.\r\n\r\nHow medication abortion works\r\nMedication abortion uses combined medications (mifepristone and misoprostol) instead of surgery to end a pregnancy. It can be done as soon as a pregnancy can be seen on an ultrasound.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, a medication abortion can be performed up to 9 weeks during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nA pregnancy needs high levels of the hormone progesterone to continue. Mifepristone (previously known as RU486) blocks the action of progesterone to stop the pregnancy from progressing. Misoprostol softens the cervix and contracts the uterus to expel the pregnancy.\r\n\r\nWhat to expect during your medication abortion appointments\r\nThe process and number of appointments for having a medication abortion varies depending on the type of clinic setting you attend, and whether certain tests (such as ultrasound and blood tests) are available on site or require separate appointments.\r\n\r\nSome clinics can offer necessary tests and medication abortion in a single initial appointment.\r\n\r\nIf you have an intrauterine device (IUD), it will need to be removed before you take the first medication (mifepristone).\r\n\r\nYou will be seen by a doctor, and often a nurse, who will usually:\r\n\r\nCheck the stage of your pregnancy – an ultrasound, urine and blood tests will be organised. Some clinics may offer tests for sexually transmissible infections (STIs).\r\nDo a confidential medical assessment – you may be asked questions about your medical history and any other relevant information (such as your sexual and reproductive health).\r\nProvide you with information (such as the types of abortion, what to expect, steps involved, and about pre- and post-abortion care available).\r\nGive you the opportunity to ask questions so you can make an informed decision about what's the best option for you.\r\nAsk you to sign a consent form (if you decide to have a medication abortion).\r\nHave a discussion about pain relief and any other medication you may require to reduce side effects.\r\nGive you a prescription for the abortion medicines – these need to be taken to a pharmacy.\r\n<+971589738375 >.

This softens the cervix and helps the uterus push out the pregnancy.\r\nStay at home for the next 6-10 hours – make other arrangements for anyone under your care (for example, school pick up).\r\nGet a responsible adult to stay with you so they can drive you to a clinic or hospital if you need any extra care.\r\nThe abortion will be completed some hours later – although it may take longer.\r\nA day or 2 of rest or reduced activity.\r\nKeep in contact via telephone with the clinic you attended or seek other expert support in case you have any questions or concerns during and after the procedure.\r\nWhat happens after taking abortion medications\r\nAfter taking the second medication abortion tablet at home, you may experience the following:\r\n\r\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, headache and fever\r\npain – usually within half an hour and generally much stronger than period pain\r\nbleeding one to four hours later – heavier than a period and there may be large clots\r\nafter 2 to 6 hours the bleeding usually settles to the level of your normal period\r\nbleeding is usually similar to a normal period for another 3 to 7 days\r\nunpredictable, irregular or prolonged bleeding can last for up to 4 weeks after a medication abortion.\r\nNote: The timing of the pain and bleeding is unpredictable. It occasionally starts before taking the second medication, but may take up to 24 hours to start.\r\n\r\nFollow-up appointments after a medication abortion\r\n<+971589738375 >.

You will be given an appointment for review in 2 weeks’ time.\r\n\r\nMedication abortion does not work in around one per cent of cases. Around 2 to 5% of people have some pregnancy tissue remaining in the uterus (womb) and will need further treatment (such as additional tablets or a small surgical procedure) to complete the abortion. Your doctor will discuss this with you.\r\n\r\nSelf-care at home after a medication abortion\r\nThe doctor or nurse will advise on how to take care of yourself in the days following the abortion. Self-care may include:\r\n\r\nusing over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication to help manage the cramps (your doctor can prescribe stronger medication if needed)\r\nusing hot packs for pain relief\r\nmassaging the painful area.\r\nTo reduce the risk of infection during the week after having the procedure, it is recommended that you do not:\r\n\r\ninsert anything into your vagina, including tampons\r\nhave vaginal sex\r\nperform any strenuous activity, including sport or heavy physical work, until the bleeding stops\r\ngo swimming or have a bath (you can shower).\r\nYour doctor will let you know about any side effects and risks and what to do if they occur.\r\n\r\nAdvantages and disadvantages of medication abortion\r\nMedication abortion is not suitable and may not work for everyone. If you have any concerns, it is important to discuss them with someone you can trust. Such as a partner, friend, family member, teacher, school counsellor or health professional.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of medication abortion include:\r\n\r\nIs effective for around 95 to 98% pregnancies (up to 9 weeks) and no further treatment is needed.\r\nDoes not need to take place in a hospital or day surgery so it doesn't require a surgeon, anaesthetist or other medical staff. This makes it a suitable alternative for people in remote areas as long as they have access to emergency care.\r\nIs a less clinical and non-surgical procedure, which some may prefer.\r\nSome people feel it is a more natural process.\r\nIt happens in a home environment.\r\nYou usually have more choice about the timing.\r\nDisadvantages of medication abortion include:\r\n<+971589738375 >.

You will also be given the number for a 24 hour hotline in case you have any out of hours concerns.\r\n\r\nPossible risks of medication abortion\r\nSerious complications of medication abortion are uncommon. They may include:\r\n\r\nHaemorrhage (very heavy bleeding) – haemorrhage requiring a blood transfusion occurs in fewer than one in 1,000. If you are filling more than 2 large pads an hour for more than 2 hours, passing clots the size of a small lemon or feel you are bleeding heavily and feel weak or faint, seek immediate medical attention.\r\nRetained products – pieces of tissue may remain in the womb and cause ongoing bleeding. These will usually pass with time without treatment. You might need repeat tablets or a small surgical procedure to remove them.\r\nContinued pregnancy – in around one per cent, medication abortion does not work and the pregnancy remains. The tablets can be repeated (if the pregnancy is no more than 9 weeks), otherwise a surgical abortion may be required.\r\nInfection (needing antibiotic treatment) – this happens to one per cent of people. Infection may cause symptoms such as pain, abnormal vaginal discharge or fever. Sometimes symptoms aren’t obvious and may include general symptoms such as tiredness, diarrhoea and vomiting.\r\nIf you are concerned about symptoms, seek medical assistance by contacting the clinic where the medication abortion took place, a GP, the 24 hotline you are given, your nearest hospital emergency department or by calling 000 for an ambulance.\r\n\r\nOther possible complications of medication abortion\r\nIf you think you are still pregnant after a week or you are not bleeding at all 24 hours after taking misoprostal, seek medical assistance straight away.\r\n\r\nIf the abortion does not occur and you remain pregnant, it is recommended that you do not continue the pregnancy. In some cases, the medications you have taken may cause malformation of the developing fetus.\r\n\r\nManaging emotions after a medication abortion\r\nAfter an abortion, most people feel relief – particularly if they had support, and were able to make a free and informed decision.\r\n\r\nIf the decision was difficult for you, you may feel sadness or have other negative feelings, especially in the short term.\r\n\r\nIf you feel you need emotional support, speak to your abortion provider or GP.\r\n\r\nRemember, if your pregnancy is unplanned and you are finding it difficult to weigh up your options, emotional support is available. <+971589738375 >.
