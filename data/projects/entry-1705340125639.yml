name: 'OpenOversight VA: The Police Data Project'
description: >-
  OpenOversight VA is creating the first and only statewide, searchable police
  transparency database. This open resource, thanks to hundreds of FOIA
  requests, includes 30,000 Virginia officers from more than 29 agencies,
  civilian complaints, body camera footage, policy documents, and court records
  free and open to the public. Our project aims to empower our community with
  the dignity of open data on our own terms, to preserve the stories of police
  violence victims, & to interrupt a cycle of harm.
