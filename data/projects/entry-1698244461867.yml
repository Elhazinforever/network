name: Historical Election Results API
description: "The Results Publication application provides an OpenAPI v3 compatible API that can be queried to obtain electoral data that is available programmatically.\r\n\r\nIt currently contains national electoral results from 2011 to the present.\r\n\r\nThe technical documentation of the API can be obtained at https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/2017/08/api-publicacion-resultados-electorales.zip so that it can be used in an API editor ( Postman, Insomnia, Swagger, etc).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, an Insomnia collection is offered with the API specification and some example queries. At the URL https://resultados.mininterior.gob.ar/desarrollo you can see a video on how to import, select and execute queries."
