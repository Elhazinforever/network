  The Support to the Electoral Dispute Resolution Oversight and Capacity
  Building Zambia (SEDROBZ) Project
description: "The “Support to the Electoral Dispute Resolution Oversight and Capacity Building Zambia (SEDROBZ)”, implemented by the Southern African Institute for Policy and Research (SAIPAR) and supported by the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (OSISA), was established in 2021 with the stated aim of assessing the compliance of Election Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanisms to regional and international standards that govern electoral justice. One of the signature initiatives of the SEDROBZ project is the tracking of election petitions filed after the 2021 elections. Between August 2021 and November 2021, SEDROBZ tracked all election petitions filed at the parliamentary and local government level on what it termed an “EDR Tracker”.\r\n\r\nMore than three decades after the return of multi-party democracy, Zambia’s EDR landscape remains fragile. Indeed, electoral disputes have become a permanent feature of Zambia’s post-electoral climate. The effectiveness of any electoral dispute resolution mechanism (EDRM) depends, in part, on the ability of that mechanism to record all electoral disputes comprehensively and accurately. Without this consolidated information, EDRM reform initiatives lack an appropriate reference point. Further, because general elections are held once every 5 years, if electoral disputes are not recorded, tracked, and analyzed, few lessons are learned before the following election cycle. This lack of introspection generally means that the same mistakes are continuously repeated. Tracking electoral disputes provides an effective overview of the status of EDRM in a particular jurisdiction and can provide important information that can inform EDRM reform efforts.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no systematic effort to comprehensively track electoral disputes in Zambia. The EDR Tracker is therefore the first of its kind, both nationally and regionally, to record and aggregate all electoral disputes filed within the formal court system. The launch of the EDR Tracker is thus of huge significance, and it is hoped that the Tracker can serve as a timely and accurate “real time” source of information on electoral disputes for lawyers, adjudicators, journalists, policymakers, the academy, and the wider public. It is also hoped that this preliminary effort can inspire regional and continental initiatives to track election petitions, particularly in those jurisdictions where large numbers of election petition filings dominate the post-election landscape.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the project set up a provision of a one-stop advisory framework for political parties on how to access EDR. The one-stop advisory services shop will be set up within the Zambia Election Information Centre (ZEIC). The shop will be manned by legal experts on electoral dispute resolution who will provide a consulting service to political parties during the electoral cycle. Services include assistance in:\r\n• Determining whether electoral complaints can be filed. • Determining the courts/mechanisms to approach and the format of filing the complaints. Services did not include litigating on behalf of political parties. Experts were drawn from Zambia and the region."
