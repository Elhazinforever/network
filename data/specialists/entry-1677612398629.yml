  Hi, I'm a Contributing Product Manager @ CKAN. CKAN is one of the most
  important vehicles for open data by being an open source platform that enables
  open data for governmental, non-profits, enterprises around the globe.
  Currently I'm working on defining product strategy for CKAN, collaborating
  with co-stewards on a weekly basis. Working on wider reach by spreading the
  word about CKAN at a scale with modern marketing tools.
