reason: "Last year I've developed a course with NASA as a subject matter expert in the ethos of open science that prompted me to be much more interested and active in the ecosystem. I'm interested in different aspects of Open Knowledge: shareable and interchangeable research data and resources, accessibility to knowledge and education, empowerment of interoperability in the web and how to make open source communities more resilient, through the practice of better governance.\r\nCurious and excited to connect with this network and get to know the people behind it!"
