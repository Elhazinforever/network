reason: "Manuel is the Deputy General Secretary at the Legislature of the Province of Córdoba. With a background in Political Science and a keen interest in digital transformation, he has contributed significantly to several key projects in the Province of Córdoba, including Ciudadano Digital, Mab Electrónico, and Recibo de Sueldo Digital, among others. In fact, Manuel has led the creation of the first-ever Open Management Portal of the government of Córdoba, and spearheaded the co-creation workshops for the inclusion of subnational goals in the 3rd National Open Government Action Plan, under the OGP framework.\r\nWhile his career path eventually led him to Political Science, he never lost sight of his other passions, such as philosophy, literature, music, journalism and communication. As a DAAD scholar at the University of Passau in Germany, he pursued his interests and is a firm believer that literature teaches us how to think. Manuel is a musician and writer.\r\nToday, he applies his diverse set of skills and experiences to his role as Deputy General Secretary, where he leads an opening strategy in the Legislature of the Province of Córdoba. In that order, the Legislature has been advancing a series of open parliament reforms (open contracting, open data, capacity building with municipal councils, and open budgets, among others). Almost all universities from the province have been involved in the process, as well as Think Tanks and civil society organizations."
