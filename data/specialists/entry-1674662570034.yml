  I have a firm belief in the importance of open science and open data. Six
  years ago I became involved with the FAIR Data movement and soon thereafter
  also with the Open Science movement.  I was a member of the Science Europe
  Research Data Management that developed the Practical Guide to the
  International Alignment of Research Data Management. I am a member of the
  GO-FAIR Data Stewardship Competence Centers Implementation Network (DSCC-IN
  PL). I am also the program director of the (first and only Eastern European)
  Data Steward School in Warsaw. My role as an expert in the field has been
  recently noted when I was invited to speak about open science and open access
  at the UN Global Urban Forum,  Euro Science Open Forum (ESOF 2022) and the
  Science Europe Conference on Open Science in 2022, among others.
