reason: "Dave has been involved in Open Data programmes since 2014, when he was technical lead for open data publishing at Bath and North East Somerset, a local authority in South West England. Working with the Bath:Hacked community group, he opened up data on air quality, energy readings across public buildings and schools, car park occupancy at 5 minute intervals, transport surveys, and more. \r\n\r\nThis wealth of public data led to a huge amount of community engagement, new tools and applications, as well as data analysis that informed public policy.\r\n\r\nDave then founded Libraries Hacked, a project to promote open data in public libraries, and create prototypes using library data. This has showcased the power of open library data using data such as library catalogues, branch locations, mobile library timetables, and library usage.\r\n\r\nIn 2022 Libraries Hacked was awarded the Data award at the OpenUK awards, while Dave was shortlisted in the Individual category."
