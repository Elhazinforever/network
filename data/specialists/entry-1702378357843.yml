  This person has been a forerunner of open advocacy in Nigeria for the last 7
  years. He has created hundreds of Wikipedia articles and trained thousands of
  others across Nigeria and Africa on open knowledge as a way of contributing to
  Wikipedia to bridge the knowledge space. The Open Foundation Nigeria space is
  really dormant and need someone like Ayokanmi who can revive it for better
  activity.
