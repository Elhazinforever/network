  Jose Luis has been working for open culture and the use of open data in
  educational and cultural environments. This work has been free and I think it
  is appropriate that it is made visible so that more people can take advantage
  (especially in the educational field) of the digital or in-person resources
  within Venezuela that he has organized and continues to make available to the
  community.
